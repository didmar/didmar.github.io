Hi, I'm a Software & Data Engineer with a PhD in AI.

I'm interested in **how software and AI can transform the way we think, work and collaborate** (Tools for Thought, Knowledge Management, Future of programming and OSes, AI alignment...).

My resume is available [here](/assets/pdf/resume.pdf), or see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/didier-marin-phd-46862a7a) page for more.

## Bio

After a PhD thesis on Reinforcement Learning for robotics, I partnered with former colleagues to create [Heuritech](https://www.heuritech.com).
My work involved building scalable data processing pipelines, integrating prediction models and leading software engineering (best practices, continuous integration...).

On my spare time, I enjoy coding [side projects](/projects/), reading, [helping others learn Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_CxcQbEicRSsQ3eL1_m2zQ) and playing jazz drums.


## Working together

I'm available as a **freelancer** to help your company with:

- **Data engineering**:
    - Understand how to use your data to make better decisions
    - Setup solutions to collect, store and process your data (e. g. data pipelines, data warehouses, data lakes)
    - Integrate external data sources (e.g. web crawling, databases...)
- **Software engineering**:
    - Improve your software development process (e.g., code review, CI/CD, testing...)
    - Build new features or fix bugs in your existing software
    - Help you migrate to a new technology stack
    - Train your team to follow best practices that will make them more productive, but also happier
- **AI engineering**:
    - Help you understand how AI can help your business
    - Build a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the potential of AI in your domain
    - Build a production-ready AI solution by integrating prediction models into your existing software

Are you are facing one of these challenges? Let's [talk about it](/contact)!
