ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a **Software & Data Engineer with a Ph.D. in AI**.

I'm interested in **how technology can transform the way we think, work, collaborate and coordinate** (AI, Tools for Thought, Knowledge Management, Future of programming and OSes...).

See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/didier-marin-46862a7a/) page for a resume.

## Bio

After a Ph.D. thesis on Reinforcement Learning for robotics, I partnered with former colleagues to create [Heuritech](https://www.heuritech.com).
My work involved building scalable data processing pipelines, integrating prediction models and leading software engineering (best practices, continuous integration...).

Currently, I'm working on building a Legal AI copilot as the CTO of [Gatewai](https://www.gatewai.tech/).

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, coding [side projects](/projects/), [helping others learn Japanese](/projects/itsuperayt/) and playing jazz drums.
