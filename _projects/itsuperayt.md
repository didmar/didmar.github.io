I create videos on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_CxcQbEicRSsQ3eL1_m2zQ) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/itsupera7) to help people learn Japanese.

# Problem

After learning Japanese for a few years and experimenting various methods, I realized that there was almost no YouTube content in French to **help Japanese learners beyond the beginner level**.

More generally, the immersion-based approach I am using is still very under-represented compared to more traditional approaches (textbooks and classes).

# Solution

In 2020, I created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_CxcQbEicRSsQ3eL1_m2zQ) to give tips how to learn languages more effectively using immersion, use the best tools available, and to keep your motivation as you hit the dreaded ["intermediate plateau"](https://selfstudyenglish.com.tw/2020/12/30/what-is-the-intermediate-plateau-and-how-to-overcome-it/).

This also inspired me to [create](/projects/furiganalyse) [a](/projects/onsei) [few](https://github.com/didmar/kanjigame-elm) [software](https://github.com/itsupera/waadoru) [tools](https://github.com/itsupera/youtube_time_tracking) to help Japanese language learners.

In 2022, I started streaming on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/itsupera7) every week as well. I play a game in Japanese, read-aloud the dialogues, explain the meaning and... look up what I don't know!

# Challenges

I am comfortable speaking in front of a large audience, but speaking in front of a camera was extremely **awkward at the start** because of the lack of feedback. With practice, I got more relaxed and stopped reading my prompt like a robot.

The most difficult part was to **keep my motivation despite the slow growth** of my audience. I purposely picked quite a niche, because there are not that many people who learn Japanese beyond a beginner level, and even less when considering only French speaker (Interestingly, I found out that non-French speaker were also interested in my content to practice French, and I even created an [easy podcast for French learners](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyylq0qHm_xpD4fBBKjZftQ) on the side!)

Getting "discovered" by the algorithm takes a while, and you have to keep going for sometimes without much feedback.
I had to **fiddle with YouTube analytics** to understand what was working and what was not, tuning the hashtags, the titles, the thumbnails, the description, the timing of the videos, etc. This made a big difference in the growth of the channel.

Speaking of thumbnails, that was a late epiphany for me: I use to spend hours on writing, filming and editing, but only a few minutes on creating a thumbnail just before publishing the video. But I realized that (for better or for worse) **the thumbnail is actually the most important part** to get people to watch the product of your hard work!
In hindsight, that may seem obvious, but a lot of creators fall into that same trap.

This on-going project is a lot of fun and helps me **improve my skills in writing, filming and editing**. I also get to meet a lot of interesting people passionate about the Japanese language and language learning in general.
